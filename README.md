# fullstackproject
This project was developed as part of the Applied AI Solutions Development program at George Brown College, demonstrating full-stack integration of data science and AI for real-world retail forecasting applications.

Deployment
The app can be viewed at https://nsternberg.pythonanywhere.com/ ( as long as the site is still up)

You can also host the site locally. Download the repository and run it using flask run after downloading the requirements in requirements.txt

The project's backend uses a naive random forest model, hosted at https://huggingface.co/theothertallguy/propredict, which hosts a large CSV needed for app.py.
